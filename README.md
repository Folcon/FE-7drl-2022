# FE-7drl-2022

This repo is for my [7drl 2022](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2022) submission.

It's based on my game [Fruit Economy](https://folcon.itch.io/fruit-economy), which ironically is probably a much less complete game than this one will end up being, as it's presently more a simulation than a game.

I decided to build this to try out some gameplay ideas without polluting the simulation.

[The itch.io project page will be here](https://folcon.itch.io/fruit-economy-7drl-2022).

Let's see how we do =)...
